The OSGi Subsystem Archive Generator Maven Plugin
------------------------------------------------------

This plugin was designed to generate an OSGi Subsystem `.esa` archive containing a manifest file and contents based on the dependencies defined in the project POM file.


Each type will instruct the plugin to generate the subsystem manifest accordingly.

The plugin can embed the declared dependencies into the generated archive.


The artifact generated by this plugin can be used by the [Repository Plugin](../osgi-repository-maven-plugin/index.html).

Quickstart
----------
The plugin provides three `packaging types` that the developer must be chosen:

* subsystem-application
* subsystem-composite
* subsystem-feature

```
    <groupId>my-project</groupId>
    <artifactId>my-osgi-repository</artifactId>
    <packaging>osgi.repository</packaging>
```


Add the following to your plugins section:

    <plugin>
        <groupId>${this.groupId}</groupId>
        <artifactId>${this.artifactId}</artifactId>
        <version>${this.version}</version>
        <extensions>true</extensions>
    </plugin>

Release your project by running `mvn releaser:release`


Prerequisites
-------------

The plugin requires **Maven ${project.prerequisites.maven}** or later and **Java 8** or later.
